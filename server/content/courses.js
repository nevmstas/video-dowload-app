      '<p>Why practice pranayama?</p>\n\n<p>Tantric vinyasa yoga teacher Jim Bennitt explains that when you can learn to control the breath, you can learn to control the mind. Prana means "vital life force" and yama means "to constrain or control." The practice of pranayama is about modifying the breath to control the life force which in turn helps to control the mind.</p>\n\n<p>When you work with prana in this way, you are inviting the opportunity to connect with a deeper aspect of yourself—the part of yourself that’s deeper than the body and even deeper than the mind. Consistent breathwork can show up in your daily life as finding more peace and clarity in the moments that you need them most.</p>\n\n<p>This workshop, Fundamentals of Pranayama, is excellent for beginners, teachers who want a refresher on how to teach a variety of breathing techniques, and the experienced practitioner who wants to be guided through their pranayama practice.</p>\n\n<p>Learn pranayama that you can use to energize, calm, or cool yourself, and to get centered. After completing each breath practice, take the time to feel the effects it had on your nervous system and your mind.</p>\n\n<p>For example, you may discover that energizing breaths are best to practice in the morning and can prepare you for more active yoga classes, and that the calming breaths are better to practice in the evening and can prepare you for restorative classes. By taking inventory at the end of each pranayama practice, you can become more attuned to the needs of your body and the quality of your thoughts.</p>\n\n<p>Take this workshop to explore:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The following breathing techniques: ujjayi (victorious breath), nadi shodhana (alternate nostril breathing), kapalabhati (skull shining breath), bhramari (bumble bee breath), sitali (cooling breath) and sitkari (hissing breath).</li>\n\t<li>The answers to frequently asked questions about pranayama.</li>\n\t<li>The use of ratio fundamentals, which include breath retention and lengthening the inhales and exhales to create an energizing or calming effect.</li>\n\t<li>A short and sweet asana sequence to prepare you for the pranayama practices.</li>\n\t<li>How to use your throat and nose as valves to extend your breath.</li>\n\t<li>An in-depth description of each practice and how it relates to asana.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Feel confident while practicing pranayama and start integrating more breath into your yoga practice.</p>',

          "Jim teaches Tantric Vinyasa Yoga: an authentic, comprehensive practice influenced by ParaYoga, Universal Yoga, the Himalayan Institute, and the Krishnamacharya lineage. Based in Chicago and co-founder of Tejas Yoga Studio, Jim's inspired teachings and demos are sought after at many conferences and studios across the country.\n\n<strong>Interview with Jim</strong>\n\n<strong>What style, tradition, and/or lineage are you a part of (if any)?</strong>\n\nThe tradition that has influenced me the most (and that I am certified in) is ParaYoga. Yogarupa Rod Stryker has been my teacher since 2002. For years I studied very closely with Rod and assisted in his trainings. I don’t see him as often anymore but still draw heavily on what I’ve learned from him. I think it’s important to have a lineage but to also continue learning from others, even if they are not necessarily yoga teachers. I learn a ton about the anatomy and movement from my physical therapist friend as well as others who have more knowledge of the body (and mind) than I do.\n\n<strong>What can I expect from your classes?</strong>\n\nIf you were to take one of my classes you would likely be familiar with most of what I do but would also notice some things that aren’t in your typical yoga classes. For example, I like to incorporate three-dimensional multi-joint movements that make your body and mind work in a way that is safe but also gets you out of your comfort zone. My classes are also very breath-centric, meaning we prioritize the breath over the shapes. To me, the quality of your inhale and exhale is what’s most important for preparing for seated meditation at the end of class. It’s all a process of “moving into stillness.”\n\nIn short, you can expect to sweat a little, breathe a lot, and leave with a sense of mental clarity.\n\n<strong>What’s on your mind these days yoga-wise?</strong>\n\nI’m super interested in helping people understand the difference between flexibility and mobility. I also love incorporating functional movement into my classes. I’ve seen too many people injure themselves in yoga by becoming overly flexible or trying too hard to get into a complex pose just because they saw someone else do it and it looks pretty. Core strength, hip mobility, and balance is what I like to focus on these days. Of course, I still always include seated breathwork and meditation. To me, that’s what makes yoga yoga.\n\n<strong>What do you like to do outside of yoga?</strong>\n\nWhen I’m not on a yoga mat, I’m on a jiu jitsu mat. I’m a brown belt at the moment and train three times a week. It gives me a chance to just be a student, have some fun, and use my body (and mind) in a completely different way.\n",

Typical entries might be: &ldquo;Foot fell asleep halfway through, will try a prop under the shin tomorrow.&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;Doing the breathing practice first made a huge difference&mdash;enjoyed practice today.&rdquo; As simple as it sounds, keeping a log can make a huge difference when it comes to helping you stay committed.

Many students find that the morning&mdash;after using the bathroom and before eating breakfast&mdash;is an ideal time. Others prefer meditating before bed or in the late afternoon. The best time is the time that works for you. Be as consistent as possible, so you easily create a habit of meditation at your chosen time each day.</span></p>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-dd05cfa3-46c0-3f4f-e3b4-9873b2882f10">Thank you for joining us!</span></p>',

Much like an encounter with the refrigerator conjures thoughts of food, and a glance at the couch invites a comfortable sprawl, catching sight of your meditation seat in a sanctified space will evoke your deepest yearnings and inspire you to do your practice.</p>\n\n<p>Choose a place that can become a sanctuary&mdash;a quiet, private space protected from outside distractions and out of public view. You may be fortunate enough to designate an entire room, but a corner in your bedroom will suffice.</p>\n\n<p>You&rsquo;ll need a meditation seat (traditionally known as your &ldquo;asana&rdquo;) which may be a neatly folded blanket topped by a cushion for support, or even a chair or bench. Keep any additional props needed to support a comfortable sitting posture nearby, as well as your mala, shawl, or journal; but otherwise keep the space uncluttered and scrupulously clean.</p>\n\n<p>A simple altar will serve as the heart of your space, calling you to your practice by providing inspiration and focus. An altar is an acknowledgement of the deeper essence of life and a bridge to the unseen&mdash;a link between our life in the world of elements and the subtle world. All altars, even public ones, serve to remind us of meaning and purpose in life, and connect us to inner strength and guidance. In religious or ritual settings, an altar is the locus for offerings made to ancestors or deities. In the context of yoga meditation, an altar inspires an offering of inner resources rather than outward ceremony or ritual, so simplicity is key.<br />\nTry a small low table or a small chest of drawers at eye level, with a tasteful and simple covering. The objects you place upon your altar give focus, substance, and energy to your highest intentions. Traditionally, a flame (from a candle or a ghee lamp), water, flowers, fruit, and incense are offered on an altar to represent the gifts of the world given to us through the five elements. Often, these are joined by objects from a pilgrimage&mdash;a stone, sanctified water, or a sacred representation (such as a picture of Our Lady of Guadalupe or a carving of Lord Ganesha). The objects themselves are not as important as whether the altar uplifts the mind and touches the heart.</p>\n\n<p>By creating a sacred space that encourages you to cultivate and nurture a devoted practice, you are one step closer to tasting the fruits of yoga&mdash;unconditional well-being and pure awareness.</p>",

The practice of <em>anuloma pranayama</em> can help to open bl0cked nostrils and clear congestion. Even if you are not congested, anuloma sensitizes the nostrils and dispels sluggishness; it&rsquo;s a wonderful practice right before nadi shodhana and meditation. <a href="https://yogainternational.com/ecourse/6-week-meditation-challenge/4/5">Learn the technique</a>, and <a href="https://yogainternational.com/ecourse/6-week-meditation-challenge/4/6">enjoy a guided practice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>When the breath is stabilized and flowing equally in both nostrils, the <em>sushumna nadi</em> is active.

              '<p>Imagine having a mind that is unwavering in its clarity, one that is ever alert in the moment yet has no trouble recalling the lessons of the past, a mind that goes where you direct it and stays where you put it. This is a well-controlled, calm, and focused mind&mdash;it is the same mind that meditates well. Meditation cultivates these qualities&mdash;but it also requires them.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;There are two reasons the mind moves about,&rdquo; the <em>Yogakundali Upanishad</em> tells us: &ldquo;the breath and the <em>vasanas </em>(deep-seated mental/emotional habits).&rdquo; Recognizing the profound connection between the nervous system and the respiratory system, the verse continues with a promise: &ldquo;If one is controlled, then the other is also controlled.&rdquo; And no one who has tried to work with their mind will doubt the wisdom of the next line: &ldquo;Of these two, the breath should be controlled first.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The breath is the external manifestation of vital energy, or <em>prana</em>. By controlling the breath we can learn to control prana, and because prana sets the mind in motion, by controlling the breath we control the mind. The pranayama practices of hatha yoga offer various techniques for developing control of the breath. Principal among them is <em>nadi shodhanam</em>, or channel purification, an exercise for unblocking and balancing the flow of vital energy.</p>\n\n<h2>Polarities</h2>\n\n<p>The two channels of the nose are a good example of the architectural dictum, &ldquo;Form follows function.&rdquo; Yoga texts, both ancient and modern, tell us that the two nostrils have different energy potentials&mdash;the left nostril gives the incoming air a negative charge as it enters the body while the right nostril gives it a positive charge.</p>\n\n<p>These same polarities, or pairs of opposites, can be found at all levels of human functioning. Our moods &ldquo;run hot or cold.&rdquo; We may be &ldquo;hot on the trail&rdquo; of an idea or our thoughts may be &ldquo;cold and calculating.&rdquo; We even describe ourselves as hot- or cold-blooded. These polarities form the backdrop for our experience of the world. As one poet reminds us, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t see things as they are, we see them as we are.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Differences in the energy of the two nostrils are beautifully symbolized in yoga literature when it speaks of the subtle energy channels in our bodies. Energy passing through the right nostril is said to travel in the &ldquo;solar&rdquo; channel, <em>pingala</em>. Energy passing through the left nostril is described as traveling along a lunar channel, <em>ida</em>. Sun and moon, male and female, active and receptive, rational and intuitive, contracting and relaxing, hot and cool, rigid and fluid&mdash;these and other pairs of opposites are captured in the archetypes of the two channels of breath.</p>\n\n<p>The poles of experience may be as easy to describe as the nose on your face, but complexity, not simplicity, is the rule here. Ida and pingala are but two of more than 72,000 channels, called <em>nadis </em>in Sanskrit, that direct the flow of vital energy throughout body and mind. Depending on our thoughts, desires, actions, and habits, this energy manifests in myriad patterns within us.</p>\n\n<p>Breathing practices have a direct effect on the flow of energy in the nadis. Through pranayama, energy can be aroused or calmed, used to produce heat or inner cooling, and directed to specific locations for the restoration of health and for longevity. As in so many other yoga practices, however, the initial focus of pranayama is purification&mdash;to cleanse the nadis of impurities that might otherwise disturb concentration and impede the natural movement of prana.</p>\n\n<p>Nadi shodhanam, or channel purification, is the first formal pranayama practice given in yoga. It is a cleansing practice. It is also called alternate nostril breathing because it involves breathing through one nostril at a time. In addition to opening the flow of energy along the nadis, this practice is an excellent preparation for meditation. It calms, purifies, and strengthens the nervous system, and leads to establishing <em>sushumna </em>breathing, the condition in which the sensation of the breath flowing through the two nostrils is united into one central stream.</p>\n\n<h2>Guidelines for Practice</h2>\n\n<p>If possible, find a qualified teacher who can demonstrate channel purification. This will allow you to observe the pace and serenity of the breath before practicing on your own. When you do it yourself, you need to pay attention to all aspects of the technique, including the steadiness of your spine in the sitting posture, the quality of your diaphragmatic breathing, the skillful manipulation of the nostrils as the stream of breath is alternated from one nostril to the other, the degree that your attention is maintained during the practice, and the internal and external setting. This list may seem overwhelming, but the practice will soon be comfortable and nearly effortless if you give it your full attention.</p>\n\n<p>It is best to do channel purification two or three times a day. The general guidelines for all yoga practices apply: practice on a light stomach, empty the bladder beforehand, and stay within your comfortable capacity. When channel purification forms part of a complete yoga practice session, it is done just after hatha postures and prior to meditation. If it is not followed immediately by meditation, you should allow some time, perhaps five minutes, to maintain and enjoy the tranquil state of mind it produces.</p>\n\n<p>To fully integrate the benefits of channel purification, it is important to cultivate a yogic lifestyle&mdash;neither overindulgent nor too ascetic. The mind needs to be alert, not fatigued. Do not practice when you have a headache or fever, or when anxiety makes you restless and agitated. Those with a seizure disorder should not practice alternate nostril breathing at all. If you have any of these conditions, practice relaxation in <em>shavasana</em>, the corpse posture, to rest the mind.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to these general suggestions, there are <strong>three essential guidelines for practicing channel purification:</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Sit with your head, neck, and trunk straight throughout the entire practice. If it is done with a bent spine, it can result in disruption of the nervous system and increased mental and physical tension. (Swami Sivananda went so far as to equate practicing with a curved spine to bombarding the spine with a hydraulic jackhammer.) Sit in any comfortable meditation posture, including sitting erect in a chair with a flat seat.</li>\n\t<li>Breathe diaphragmatically with no pauses. It is easy to neglect the natural, diaphragmatic movement of the breath while concentrating on the manipulation of the nostrils. Don&rsquo;t let this happen. Keep the breath deep, smooth, and relaxed. With practice, the length of the breath will gradually increase.</li>\n\t<li>Close off the nostrils lightly. It is common to see students focusing so intently on manipulating the nostrils that they bend the nose to the side by applying too much pressure on the nostrils with the finger and thumb. The nose should not be distorted nor should the balanced alignment of the head and neck be altered.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The nostril used to begin the practice is commonly determined by the time of day. The maxim &ldquo;right at night&rdquo; (and, therefore, left in the morning) is an easy way to remember. Begin your evening practice using the right nostril. In the morning, begin with the left. If you practice at midday, begin by exhaling through the nostril which is the least open (the passive nostril). If the nostrils are flowing equally (which is less common than you might expect) you may start on either side.</p>\n\n<p>Yoga breathing exercises generally begin with an exhalation. This is both symbolic and practical. It reminds us that before we are ready to receive energy from the universe we must prepare ourselves by emptying the wastes and impurities in our minds and bodies&mdash;including egoism. Practically speaking, the exhalation is a cleansing breath; it readies the lungs and nervous system for the inhalation, which is the potent breath.</p>\n\n<h2>The Technique</h2>\n\n<p>There are a number of patterns for alternating the breath in the nostrils. <strong>For now, we&rsquo;ll stick to one of the best methods for getting started.</strong> Because this practice requires only a few minutes to complete, it is an excellent beginning technique; advancing students can expand it and incorporate longer variations.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Sit with your head, neck, and trunk in a straight line. Take time to establish a sense of balance and stillness in your posture. Let your body relax.</li>\n\t<li>Become aware of your breathing, and allow your breath to become deep and smooth. Let it flow without pause. Feel the upper abdomen, sides, and lower back expand with inhalation and contract with exhalation. (There is also a very modest expansion of the chest wall, but diaphragmatic contraction and expansion predominates and should be clearly felt.)</li>\n\t<li>Focus on the breath touching the nostrils. Feel the warm touch of exhalation and the cool touch of inhalation. Establish a steady awareness of the flow of breath&mdash;try to minimize breaks in both your breathing and your awareness.</li>\n\t<li>Maintaining your posture and your diaphragmatic breathing, bring your right hand up to your nose. Arrange your right hand in <em>vishnu mudra</em>, a position in which the index and middle fingers are either curled to touch the base of the thumb or rested lightly on the area between the eyebrows. The thumb closes the right nostril, and the ring finger closes the left. Press lightly on the side of the nostril you are closing&mdash;just below the point where the bony part of the nose begins.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We&rsquo;ll begin with an evening practice. Take three breaths, out and in, through the right nostril; switch to the left nostril and take three breaths, out and in; then take three breaths out and in through both nostrils. These nine breaths complete one round of channel purification. Keep the breaths silent, smooth, and equal in length. Do not hold the breath. (If the nostrils are too congested for practice, you will want to learn how to do the nasal wash to clean them.) Reverse this pattern for morning practice&mdash;begin on the&nbsp;left side, then go to the right, and then breathe with both nostrils.</p>\n\n<p>Now lower your hand and bring your attention to the breath flowing in the nostril that feels most open. Relax and attend to the sensation there for a number of breaths. Next, shift your attention to the breath in the more passive nostril. Keep your focus there for some time (you may find that the nostril opens as you concentrate). Simply attend to the flow of the breath. Finally, merge these two streams in your awareness, sensing the breath as if it is flowing in one central stream. It is as if the mind, breath, and energy become one. Let your focus on the breath become relaxed and one-pointed.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, the mind often wanders, becomes identified with some other thought process, and loses its focus. Part of the challenge of pranayama is to learn to focus on the breath and allow thoughts to come and go without distracting you. Your focusing power will increase gradually with daily practice, and soon your attention will rest wherever it is placed.</p>\n\n<p>Those who are experienced with the practice of channel purification have noted that it has two important effects on meditation: it turns the mind inward, and it seems to provide energy for focusing the mind. With repetition, the fingers do their work automatically, and nothing impedes the joy of concentration.</p>\n\n<p><em>Sandra Anderson and Rolf Sovik are the authors of </em>Yoga: Mastering the Basics<em>.</em></p>\n\n<h2>Breathing Patterns</h2>\n\n<p>There are three principal patterns for alternating the breath in the nostrils, which are summarized below in the form of an evening practice. All begin with an exhalation through the right nostril, and finish with three resting breaths. This constitutes one round.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pattern 1.</strong> Close the left nostril and exhale and inhale through the right. Then switch and exhale and inhale through the left nostril. Continue switching from side to side two more times and take three resting breaths through both nostrils.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pattern 2.</strong> Exhale and inhale three times through the right nostril and then switch and exhale-inhale three times through the left nostril. Then take three resting breaths through both nostrils.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pattern 3.</strong> This pattern entails switching sides between the exhalation and the inhalation, as follows: Exhale through the right nostril, switch and inhale through the left. Continue this pattern twice more for a total of three breaths. Then exhale left and inhale right for a total of three breaths before taking three resting breaths through both nostrils. If you are doing more than one round, start the next round on the opposite side.</p>\n\n<p>No matter which of the three patterns you are using, let your awareness rest first in one nostril and then the other. <em>Nadi shodhanam</em> heightens your sensitivity to the sensation of the breath in the nostrils&mdash;the initial focus for meditation in many traditions. Use this opportunity to sensitize your awareness of the flow of breath. That awareness, in turn, opens into the subtle system of energy within.</p>\n\n<p>Listen to Sandra Anderson give an audio practice of nadi shodanam.<br />\n<iframe frameborder="no" height="166" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/264748430%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-ufvga&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false" width="100%"></iframe> &nbsp;</p>',

This is also progress, and the mind will gradually clear as we continue meditating and begin to resolve inner conflicts.</p>\n\n<p>All of us face stressful situations in life&mdash;challenges to our calmness and stability. Stress can inspire us to make changes and spur accomplishment, but if not managed properly, stress takes a heavy toll on our physical and mental health. Stress plays a role in many chronic diseases, as well as reduced quality of life, but meditation has been shown to mitigate the negative consequences. Read more about stress and how to manage it from Dr. Carrie Demers: <a href="https://yogainternational.com/ecourse/6-week-meditation-challenge/5/3">How to Rewire Your Stress Response</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Here are two stress-busting practices to restore physical and mental balance to your life.

It can be used at the end of a longer sequence of your favorite postures, or on its own to release tension from the body and make it easy to relax deeply.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s another resource for &nbsp;managing stress&mdash;prayer. Prayer is one of the best ways to acknowledge problems in life, and to use the wellsprings of emotion to deepen and inspire your practice. Bring heart to your practice by saying a prayer in your own words or any prayer that touches your heart. Prayers can set the mood and intention at the beginning of your practice and provide a sense of closure at the end. Even a simple prayer like &ldquo;Om shantih, shantih, shantih&rdquo; may bring direction and joy to your practice.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Here are a couple of choices to get you started (Link), including the beloved St. Francis Prayer from the Christian tradition.

              "<p>Remember the tale &ldquo;The Lady or the Tiger?&rdquo; As it ends, the hero is standing before two identical doors: one conceals a beautiful maiden; the other, a ferocious tiger. The hero must open one of these doors&mdash;the choice is his&mdash;but he has no way of knowing which will bring forth the lady and which will release the tiger.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m sometimes reminded of this story when a patient is describing one of the symptoms of chronic stress: headaches, indigestion, ulcers, tight muscles, high blood pressure, or some combination of these. When I point out that the symptom is stress-related, the patient seems resigned&mdash;stress is such a constant in most people&rsquo;s lives that all the doors seem to have tigers lurking behind them. Most of the people who find their way to my office know the fight-or-flight response is hardwired into our nervous system and many have come to accept a constant feeling of tension as normal, even inevitable.</p>\n\n<p>It isn&rsquo;t. Like the hero in the story, we have a choice. There is another door, another response to the challenges of everyday living that is also hardwired into our nervous system. And unlike the hero, whose destiny rests with chance, we can discover which door is which. A general understanding of the nervous system and how it responds to stress, coupled with training in three fundamental yoga techniques, make it possible for us to distinguish one door from the other. Practicing these techniques gives us the power to choose the lady while leaving the door that unleashes the tiger firmly closed.</p>\n\n<h2>Releasing the Tiger</h2>\n\n<p>The autonomic nervous system controls all the body&rsquo;s involuntary processes: respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure, gastric juice secretion, peristalsis, body temperature, and so on. It has two main components or branches&mdash;the sympathetic and the parasympathetic. When we feel stressed, our brain activates the sympathetic nervous system, which has come to be known as the fight-or-flight response. This causes the adrenal medulla to secrete adrenaline (also called epinephrine), a hormone that circulates through the bloodstream, affecting almost every organ. Adrenaline revs up the body to survive a threat to life and limb: The heart pumps faster and harder, causing a spike in blood pressure; respiration increases in rate and moves primarily into the chest; airways dilate to bring more oxygen into the body; blood sugar rises to provide a ready supply of fuel; some blood vessels constrict to shunt blood away from the skin and the core of the body, while others dilate to bring more blood to the brain and limbs. The result? A body pumped up to fight or run, and a mind that is hyperalert.</p>\n\n<p>This response is a crucial reaction to a life-threatening event: when we find ourselves face-to-face with a mountain lion, the stress response dramatically increases our chances of surviving. And we&rsquo;ve all heard stories of fantastic feats: the mom lifting a car off her trapped child, the firefighter carrying a man twice his size from a burning building. These are the benefits of the sympathetic nervous system. Any time we respond quickly and decisively when a life is at stake, this is the system to thank.</p>\n\n<p>The fight-or-flight response is meant to be triggered sporadically, in those rare moments when we are actually in peril. Ideally, it remains dormant until the next close call (weeks, months, or even years later!). But in many of us this response is triggered daily, even hourly. Some people&mdash;soldiers, tightrope walkers, members of a SWAT team, for example&mdash;do find themselves in life-or-death situations frequently. But for most of us, such situations are rare: a mugging, a traffic accident, a close-up with a bear in the backcountry. Once the threatening event is over, hormonal signals switch off the stress response, and homeostasis is reestablished.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is that for many of us the fight-or-flight response rarely switches off, and stress hormones wash through the body almost continuously.</p>\n\n<p>The source of our stress is psychological rather than physical&mdash;a perception that something crucial to us is threatened.</p>\n\n<p>Fear of the unknown, major changes in our circumstances, uncertainty about the future, our negative attitudes&mdash;all these are sources of stress. Today we worry more about our jobs, our relationships, or getting stuck in traffic than we do about fighting off a wild animal, but even though the perceived threat is psychological, it still triggers the archaic survival response.</p>\n\n<p>The upshot is that our bodies are in a constant state of tension, ready to fight or flee, and this causes a host of physical problems. You can see what some of these are if you look again at what happens when adrenaline courses through the body: elevated blood pressure, rapid shallow breathing, high blood sugar, and indigestion. What is more, adrenaline makes our platelets stickier, so our blood will clot quickly if we are wounded. This increases our chances of surviving a physical injury&mdash;but chronically sticky platelets are more apt to clot and create blockages in our arteries. And this sets the stage for a heart attack or a stroke.</p>\n\n<p>The damage doesn&rsquo;t end there. When we are constantly in fight-or-flight mode, the adrenal cortex begins to secrete cortisol, a steroid whose job is to help us adapt to a prolonged emergency by ensuring that we have enough fuel. Cortisol acts on the liver and muscle tissues, causing them to synthesize sugars (glucose) and fats and release them into the bloodstream. From the body&rsquo;s viewpoint, this is a reasonable response&mdash;dumping fat and sugar into the blood will help us survive a shipwreck, for example. But when this fuel is not metabolized in response to prolonged physical duress, disease results. Excess sugar in the bloodstream leads to diabetes, and excess fat to high cholesterol/high triglycerides. Both conditions boost our chances of developing heart disease.</p>\n\n<p>The steroids cortisol and cortisone quell inflammation in autoimmune diseases and asthma, and so are useful when used infrequently and for brief periods, but their constant presence in the bloodstream suppresses immune function. This causes the white blood cells&mdash;those hardy defenders against bacteria, viruses, cancer cells, fungi, and other harmful microorganisms&mdash;to become sluggish. And this makes us more prone to disease, especially cancer and chronic infections like Lyme disease, hepatitis, and the Epstein-Barr virus.</p>\n\n<p>Sounds grim, doesn&rsquo;t it? It is. It&rsquo;s a tiger. A chronically activated sympathetic nervous system keeps the body under constant pressure. If we ignore early warning symptoms&mdash;tight shoulders, digestive upset, recurring headaches, an increasing tendency to lose our temper or become easily upset&mdash;sooner or later the tiger will tear us up. But we can make another choice. The autonomic nervous system has another component, the parasympathetic nervous system. Rather than living under the tyranny of a ramped-up sympathetic nervous system, we can learn to trigger the parasympathetic system, the rest-and-digest response, instead.</p>\n\n<p>Just as the fight-or-flight response automatically kicks in at the threat of danger, the rest-and-digest response automatically responds to our sense of equilibrium. When it is activated, the heart rate drops, blood pressure falls, and respiration slows and deepens. Blood flow to the core of the body is reestablished&mdash;this promotes good digestion, supports the immune system, and infuses us with a sense of well-being.</p>\n\n<p>We unconsciously achieve this state on vacation, in the throes of a hearty laugh, or in deep sleep. It feels good, and it offers a much needed respite from the hectic pace we set for ourselves. But we have come to accept stress as the norm and to expect the feeling of relaxed well-being to come about only sporadically&mdash;and so it does. We release the tiger a dozen times a day, even though the other door is also there in every moment. Once we learn to open it at will, we can override the harmful habit of triggering our stress response by activating the rest-and-digest component of our nervous system instead.</p>\n\n<h2>Greeting the Lady</h2>\n\n<p>I use a variety of natural therapies in my medical practice, but the basic treatments are drawn from yoga&mdash;stretching, breathing, relaxation, and meditation&mdash;and these techniques are especially effective when it comes to managing stress. You already know from personal experience that aerobic exercise is excellent for dissipating stress-created tension, and that sugar, caffeine, and spicy food contribute to jangling your nervous system and shortening your temper. You are probably also familiar with the relaxing effects of practicing yoga postures&mdash;they teach us to move and stretch our tense, strained bodies and to focus on the breath. But do you know that breathing slowly and deeply is the easiest way to activate the rest-and-digest system? That is one reason yoga classes are so popular&mdash;they soothe frazzled nerves and quiet anxious minds. But yoga also works at an even deeper level: it reestablishes healthy breathing patterns, teaches us to relax consciously and systematically, and gives us the opportunity to explore the inner workings of our minds through meditation. These techniques&mdash;both separately and in combination&mdash;nourish and strengthen the parasympathetic nervous system so that the relax-and-digest response becomes our normal mode. The fight-or-flight response is then reserved for emergencies, as nature intended. So let&rsquo;s take a look at some ways we can open Door Number Two.</p>\n\n<h3>Diaphragmatic Breathing</h3>\n\n<p>Babies and young children breathe deeply and fully, using the dome-shaped diaphragm that separates the chest and abdominal cavities to move air in and out of their lungs. Their bellies are relaxed and move in concert with their breath. This is the natural, healthy way to breathe. But as we grow up we are taught to constrict the abdomen (Pull your stomach in and stand up straight!), and that training, coupled with an unconscious tendency to tighten the belly when we experience stress, disrupts the natural flow of our breath. With the abdomen pulled in, the breath is confined to the upper portion of the lungs (from about the nipple line up). And because this breathing pattern is perceived by the body to be a stress response, it reinforces the fight-or-flight reaction.</p>\n\n<p>Diaphragmatic breathing, on the other hand, activates the relax-and-digest response by stimulating the primary mediator of the parasympathetic nervous system, the vagus nerve. This nerve travels from the brain to nearly all the thoracic and abdominal organs (&ldquo;vagus&rdquo; comes from the same root as &ldquo;vagabond&rdquo;), and triggers a cascade of calming effects. Most of the time we wait for it to be activated by something pleasant and hope for a trickle-down effect, not realizing that the nerve (and hence the entire parasympathetic nervous system) can be turned on from the bottom up by diaphragmatic breathing.</p>\n\n<p>Of all the processes regulated by the autonomic nervous system (heart rate, blood pressure, secretion of gastric juices, peristalsis, body temperature, etc.), only breathing can be controlled consciously. And in doing so, we stimulate the branch of the vagus nerve that innervates the diaphragm (which carries a message to the other vagus branches and the brain) to activate the entire rest-and-digest response. This is why the first step in reversing our chronic stress response is to learn to breathe again the way we were born to breathe.</p>\n\n<p>If you haven&rsquo;t been trained in diaphragmatic breathing, find an experienced teacher and practice every day until it once again becomes a habit. Then, as you develop the skill of breathing from the diaphragm in the course of your daily activities, you will begin to experience your breath as a barometer for the nervous system. As long as you are breathing deeply and from the diaphragm, you will find that you can access a feeling of calm and balance even when you are confronted with an unpleasant situation. And you will also notice that if you allow your breath to become shallow by breathing from your chest, anxiety creeps in, your muscles tighten, and your mind begins to race and spin. When this agitated breathing is prolonged, it creates an unsettled and defensive outlook on life. Once you know this from your own experience, you can make a different choice.</p>\n\n<h3>Systematic Relaxation</h3>\n\n<p>To activate the parasympathetic nervous system, diaphragmatic breathing makes an excellent beginning. But we need to do more, particularly when we have spent years unconsciously flinging open the door to the tiger&rsquo;s cage. Daily periods of relaxation are a must. When I tell my patients this, many of them say they relax while they watch TV or read or knit or socialize. The problem is that while these activities distract the mind from its usual worries (and so provide some relief), they do little to relieve the stress we hold in the form of muscular contraction and tension.</p>\n\n<p>To reverse well-established habits of holding tension in our bodies, we need to work with what the yogis call the energy body (pranamaya kosha). Systematic relaxation practices offer a precise, orderly technique for releasing tension from head to toe. There are a number of these techniques, and like all yoga practices, they are best learned from an experienced teacher, and then honed through patient practice. They range in complexity from simple tension/relaxation exercises and point-to-point breathing practices to techniques that require making fine distinctions among various points in the energy body. But all involve moving our attention through the body in a methodical fashion, usually while resting in shavasana (corpse pose). And all require that we withdraw our attention from the drama of our lives. For the duration of the practice, we let go of our memories, plans, worries, and fantasies, and focus on what we are doing here and now as we move our awareness calmly and quietly from one part of the body to another.</p>\n\n<p>Breathing from the diaphragm, while systematically bringing our full attention to one point in the body after another, not only releases tension and fatigue in the places where we rest our attention, it also augments the energy flow among those points. This promotes both healing and cleansing. Further, because full engagement with a systematic relaxation practice requires that we clear our minds and attend fully to the present moment, we are also refining a skill that opens the door to meditation.</p>\n\n<h3>Meditation</h3>\n\n<p>Since stress begins with the perception that our lives (or at least our sense of well-being) are in danger, working with the mind to alter our perceptions is the most powerful technique for quieting our stress response. Most of what activates our fight-or-flight response is not a matter of life or death. We may feel pressured to accomplish a certain task or worried about what will happen at tomorrow&rsquo;s meeting&mdash;but our lives don&rsquo;t depend upon the outcome. With rare exceptions, the habitual thought patterns that create the experience of stress for us are overreactions to events in our lives. Instead of responding in a way that floods the body with adrenaline, however, we can reframe the experience to make it not only less stressful, but also more accurate in reflecting what is really happening (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only in a traffic jam, I&rsquo;m not at death&rsquo;s door.&rdquo; &ldquo;I want to please this person, but if I don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m not going to be fired.&rdquo;) This goes a long way toward quieting the fight-or-flight response, and it is a skill that comes with experience in meditation.</p>\n\n<p>Meditation helps us understand our mental habits by giving us the opportunity to observe them from a neutral vantage point. This is why I often prescribe meditation to my patients as a way to manage stress. I don&rsquo;t mean to minimize meditation as a means of spiritual transformation, but in its early stages, one of the most delicious benefits of meditation practice is seeing that it is possible to avoid getting sucked into the banter and hysteria of our mental chatter. Meditation allows us to witness that banter&mdash;to observe it impartially&mdash;without being smack in the middle of it. It&rsquo;s like watching a rainstorm from a warm, dry room. The peace we feel when we are watching our minds rather than identifying with our thoughts is the peace that is at our core.</p>\n\n<p>When you are first learning to meditate, the mind will wander away from the object of meditation to dwell on some other thought. This will happen again and again. Your job is to gently and repeatedly bring your attention back to your object of meditation, and to do it patiently, without judgment. Sometimes it may seem as if the distracting thoughts are like movie images projected onto a personal viewing screen in your mind. And some may be strange and wild. But you are in the rest-and-digest mode, and as strange as they are, your projections don&rsquo;t trigger the fight-or-flight response. The ability to simply observe them is evidence that they aren&rsquo;t you. And the ability to distinguish between the inner observer in you and the chaotic jumble in your mind means that you can respond with equanimity, rather than react and flood your body with stress hormones.</p>\n\n<p>The more we practice meditation, the more we will be able to discriminate between what is real and what is not&mdash;between what is truly life-threatening and what is just a habitual overreaction. And once we begin to see that almost everything that triggers our sympathetic nervous system is merely a habitual overreaction, we can begin to make different choices. Instead of reacting to an unpleasant event, we can cushion the jarring effect on our nervous system by observing it in the same way that we observe our mental chatter in meditation and by consciously breathing from the diaphragm.</p>\n\n<p>This is likely to prove challenging in the beginning. When your spouse or a coworker snaps at you, you may find yourself halfway into an angry retort before you notice that you have switched to chest breathing. Then you need to remind yourself to breathe from the diaphragm and to find a neutral vantage point. But this skill comes with time, particularly when you are sitting for meditation regularly, practicing diaphragmatic breathing, and punctuating your day with a systematic relaxation practice. And as you choose to activate your rest-and-digest response consciously and continuously, you will find yourself in fight-or-flight mode only when your car skids on a patch of ice or the cat knocks over a candle and sets the curtains on fire. Your health will improve, to say nothing of your outlook on life. You have learned to choose the right door.</p>",

              "<p><strong>I have been trying to meditate for six months without success. I can only focus on the mantra for a few moments before I start daydreaming, making plans, or attempting to solve a problem. How can I turn my mind inward?</strong><br />\nMeditation is possible only when the mind is one-pointed, organized, calm, and tranquil. A fragmented mind cannot be turned inward, and so the first step is to collect the fragments by training the mind to concentrate. This is tricky in the beginning because concentrating a scattered mind is like collecting droplets of mercury&mdash;they slip away when you try to pick them up. Similarly when you try to collect and concentrate your scattered mind it slips away and you cannot get a good grip on all those hundreds of pieces.</p>\n\n<p>A mind that is in the habit of running from one object to another cannot concentrate on one object for a prolonged period, and if you attempt to force it, it will make excuses and play tricks. While you are concentrating on one object&mdash;your breath, for example&mdash;another object flashes before your mind and the mind runs after it. When you notice that the mind is no longer trained on the breath, you bring it back, but before long it is distracted again. You bring it back, it runs off again. Eventually you give up in frustration.</p>\n\n<p>That is why in the beginning it is not advisable to force your mind to focus on one object for a long time. A gradual approach is required. Asking a mind that is used to thinking of 30 things in 10 minutes to think of only one thing for 10 minutes is asking too much.&nbsp;Compromise by creating a situation in which you are neither forcing your mind to focus on one object for a long period of time nor letting it run constantly from one object to another. Provide the mind with a series of objects; focus it on one for a short time, then allow it to move to the next object in the series before it becomes rebellious.</p>\n\n<p>Training the mind to travel from one point to another point according to your plan is the basis of all systematic relaxation exercises. This technique provides an environment where the mind can slow down as it moves from one point to the next in your body, so instead of suffocating the undisciplined, scattered mind, you are training it. It can still move from one place to another but instead of jumping from Florida to Las Vegas, from a phone conversation to what you are planning for supper, you are allowing it to travel from your forehead to your eyebrows, moving systematically through the body to the fingertips and toes and back to the forehead. In the 10 minutes it takes for the mind to move from point to point through the body it becomes concentrated. And this way a systematic and gentle mental training has begun.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If slowing down the movement of the mind is the goal, then why not simply ask the mind to attend to a series of thoughts at a slow pace? Is there a specific reason for confining the mind to the body and asking it to travel from one point to the next?</strong><br />\nThe relationship between the mind and the body is like the relationship between master and servant: mind is master and body is servant. When the servant sees that the master is dull and careless, the servant becomes careless too, and the body does not receive any guidance or motivation from a careless and scattered master. But when the servant knows that the master is attentive and vigilant, the servant becomes alert and active. For example, all the activities of the body are dependent on decisions made by the mind. The organs and bodily systems of an absent-minded person or a person with a disturbed and distracted mind are sluggish. But when the body notices that the mind is making its rounds, checking all departments&mdash;the brain, nervous system, circulatory system, respiratory system, etc.&mdash;it becomes alert and active.</p>\n\n<p>This is because the mind is a flow of energy. When it is moving from one place to another throughout the nervous system and the energy channels, it automatically notes toxins and impurities that impede its flow, and the bodily systems involved in the cleansing process usually rush to begin removing them. Thus in the course of this self-guided journey of the mind from one point to another, the energy channels are unblocked, impurities are removed, and a deeper level of cleansing begins.</p>\n\n<p>What is more, after practicing systematic relaxation over a period of time, the mind gradually begins to sense that turning inward leads to a delightful sense of ease and stillness. Searching for happiness, it has been running in the external world, often finding only disappointment and frustration. But once it turns inward and slows down it encounters the centers of peace and tranquility within&mdash;for example, at the heart or the eyebrow center. This encounter leads it to wonder why it is wasting time running here and there in the external world when the best joy is within. And this dawning awareness causes the mind to become less interested in running after the objects of the world, which in turn allows the mind to go back to that restful place voluntarily, without repressing a desire for worldly objects. The delight that it finds inside overshadows the charms and temptations of the external world. The natural and almost effortless process of meditation begins at this point.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I have been using relaxation techniques with some success to train my mind to turn inward and confine its movement to the space occupied by my body. Yet it still pulls my attention here and there. What should I do now?</strong><br />\nThe first step of meditation is relaxation. In the scriptures the process of relaxation is called&nbsp;<em>pratyahara</em>&nbsp;(the withdrawal of the mind and senses). The next step is to focus the mind on one object for a longer period of time. This is called&nbsp;<em>dharana&nbsp;</em>(concentration). The best way to begin practicing concentration is to focus the mind on the breath. Observe it as it flows between the nostrils and the heart center. With inhalation the mind is traveling to the heart center and with the exhalation it is traveling from the heart center to the tip of the nostrils. Eliminate the pause between inhalation and exhalation and feel as though your breath is an uninterrupted stream of energy traveling between the nostrils and the heart region. Then focus on the touch of cool air at the bridge between the nostrils when you inhale and the touch of warm air as you exhale. This will confine your mind to the bridge of the nostrils rather than the space between the nostrils and the heart area, and your concentration will become more condensed, potent, and refined.</p>\n\n<p>Soon, however, you will notice that the mind is refusing to watch the flow of the breath at the bridge between the nostrils. Its tendency is to move outward, and it will try to slip away again. To manage this, move to the next level of concentration by providing an object of concentration, more concrete and profound than simple breath awareness. It is at this stage that the yogis introduce meditation on the sound&nbsp;<em>so-hum</em>. While inhaling, mentally listen to the sound &ldquo;sooooooo,&rdquo; and while exhaling, listen to the sound &ldquo;hummmm.&rdquo; Synchronize the sound&nbsp;<em>so-hum</em>&nbsp;with the inhalation and the exhalation and let your mind be so absorbed that the sound, the breath, and the mind become an inseparable stream of awareness. This will bring a higher level of joy and restfulness to the mind, enabling it to drop all other objects effortlessly.</p>",

A fragmented mind cannot be turned inward, and so the first step is to collect the fragments by training the mind to concentrate. This is tricky in the beginning because concentrating a scattered mind is like collecting droplets of mercury—they slip away when you try to pick them up. Similarly...",

              "<p>You want to attain a state of happiness that is free from all pains and miseries. Yet you constantly live with fears, concerns, strain, and struggle. Why? Because you do not live in the moment, you are not fully present and aware. Your inner and outer conflicts prevent you from dealing with the situations that come before you and living in harmony with those who are close to you. These conflicts keep you from accomplishing the tasks that you have placed before yourself.</p>\n\n<p>Meditation is a definite process for resolving conflicts. It is the simple and exact process of becoming aware of who you are. It is learning to know yourself as you really are. Meditation is a practice of gently freeing yourself from the worries that gnaw at you, so that you can be free and respond to the needs of the moment, and experience the joy of being fully present. Meditation is not what you think, for it is beyond thinking. You do not meditate on your problems in order to solve them, but through meditation you see through the problems you have set up for yourself.</p>\n\n<h3>The World Within</h3>\n\n<p>Meditation is a practical means for calming yourself, for letting go of your biases and seeing what is, openly and clearly. It is a way of training the mind so that you are not distracted and caught up in its endless churning. Meditation teaches you to systematically explore your inner dimensions. It is a system of commitment, not commandment. You are committing to yourself, to your path, and to the goal of knowing yourself.</p>\n\n<p>Meditation is not a ritual belonging to any particular religion, culture, or group. It is a method of knowing the one reality from which all religions spring. For example, the Bible clearly says, &ldquo;Be still and know that I am God.&rdquo; Learning how to be still is the method of meditation. And if you meditate regularly you will find that you have become more calm, yet alert to what is needed in the present moment.</p>\n\n<p>Most people associate calmness with passivity, but the peace that meditation brings releases energy. Worry and preoccupation dissipate your strength. Meditation frees the energy that has been bound in your mental discord so that you can apply yourself one-pointedly to whatever you decide to do. Meditation will lead your mind to become more concentrated, so that you can fully focus on whatever you choose. Because of this, those who meditate will learn almost anything more easily and more quickly.</p>\n\n<p>From childhood onward, you are taught to examine and understand things in the external world, but nobody teaches you to look within and understand the mind and its various states. All of your training has been to know the outer world, and to become skillful at manipulating the external world for your own benefit. But unless you learn to know yourself, whatever you do in the external world will not produce the results you want. If a tire is out of balance, no matter how wonderfully it was designed in other respects, it will not function properly. Unless you achieve inner balance, no matter how much you know about performing in the outer world, you will fall short of your goals. Meditation is the means of achieving this inner balance.</p>\n\n<p>Those who have examined the objects of the external world understand their transitory nature and know that life has more to give. Then they start searching within themselves and conducting &ldquo;inner research.&rdquo; Meditation is a systematic technique of inner research. It is like a ladder with many rungs which finally leads to the roof, and from there one can see the vast horizon all around.</p>\n\n<p>Meditation will lead you to a state of inner joy. You think that pleasure comes from your contact with the objects of the world, but there is an inner and finer joy that you have not yet tasted. Those who have been researchers in the external world, who have examined its pleasures and joys, discover that the highest of all joys is meditation, and this joy leads to that eternal joy called samadhi. Such great ones like to keep their eyes partially closed, looking into the innermost light that shines within this frame of life.</p>\n\n<p>Meditation will give you a tranquil mind. Meditation will make you aware of the reality deep within. Meditation will make you fearless; meditation will make you calm; meditation will make you gentle; meditation will make you loving; meditation will give you freedom from fear; meditation will lead you to the state of inner joy. If you understand these goals and want to meditate, then it will help you, but if you are expecting to become rich through meditation, then don&rsquo;t do it.</p>\n\n<h3>Full Attention</h3>\n\n<p>Meditation is not a difficult task that you must force upon yourself; once you experience that inner joy you will spontaneously want to meditate as much as you now look forward to outer pleasures. Nevertheless, it is very helpful to establish a routine to your meditative practice. Just as you eat at certain times of the day, and look forward to eating as those times approach, so too, by developing the habit of meditating at the same time each day your whole being&mdash;your body, breath, and mind&mdash;will look forward to meditating at that time. You should sit down every day at exactly the same time. Establish a specific time for your practice and do your practice every day at that time.</p>\n\n<p>The first thing you have to learn is to be still. This process begins with physical stillness. According to the tradition that we follow, the asana, or meditative posture, is carefully selected according to your nature and capacity, and you are guided by a competent teacher to keep your head, neck, and trunk straight. After choosing a sitting posture, good students learn to become accomplished in it.</p>\n\n<p>After accomplishing stillness with the help of the meditative posture, you will become aware of obstacles arising from muscle twitching, tremors occurring in various parts of the body, shaking, and itching. These obstacles arise because the body has never been trained to be still. We are trained to move in the external world faster and faster, but nobody trains us to remain still. To learn this stillness, you should form a regular habit, and to form this habit you should learn to be regular and punctual, practicing the same posture at the same time and at the same place every day until the body stops rebelling against the discipline given to it. This step, though basic, is important and should not be ignored. Otherwise, you will not be able to reap the fruits of meditation and your efforts will be wasted.</p>\n\n<p>You should find a simple, uncluttered, quiet place where you will not be disturbed. Sit on the floor with a cushion under you or in a firm chair, with your back straight and your eyes closed. Then bring your awareness slowly down through your body, allowing all of the muscles to relax except those that are supporting your head, neck, and back. Take your time and enjoy the process of letting go of the tension in your body. Meditation is the art and science of letting go, and this letting go begins with the body and then progresses to thoughts.</p>\n\n<p>Once the body is relaxed and at peace, bring your awareness to your breath. Notice which part of your lungs are being exercised as you breathe. If you are breathing primarily with your chest you will not be able to relax. Let your breathing come primarily through the movement of the diaphragm. Continue to observe your breath without trying to control it. At first the breath may be irregular, but gradually it will become smooth and even, without pauses and jerks.</p>\n\n<p>Meditation is a process of giving your full attention to whatever object you have chosen. In this case you are choosing to be aware of the breath. Allow yourself to experience your breathing in an open and accepting way. Do not judge or attempt to control or change it. Open yourself so fully that eventually there is no distinction between you and the breathing. In this process many thoughts will arise in your mind: &ldquo;Am I doing this right? When will this be over? My nostril is clogged&mdash;should I get up and blow my nose before I continue? Perhaps I should have closed the window. I forgot to make an important call. My neck hurts.&rdquo; Hundreds of thoughts may come before you and each thought will call forth some further response: a judgment, an action, an interest in pursuing the thought further, an attempt to get rid of the thought.</p>\n\n<p>At this point, if you simply remain aware of this process instead of reacting to the thought, you will become aware of how restless your mind is. It tosses and turns like you do on a night when you cannot fall asleep. But that is only a problem when you identify with the mind and react to the various thoughts it throws at you. If you do, you will be caught in a never-ending whirlwind of restless activity. But if you simply attend to those thoughts when they arise, without reacting, or if you react and attend to the reaction, then they cannot really disturb you. Remember&mdash;it is not the thoughts that disturb you, but your reaction to them. It is not a sound that disturbs your meditation, but your reaction to it.</p>\n\n<p>Meditation is very simple. It is simply attending. You can begin by attending to your breath, and then if a thought comes, attend to it, notice it, be open to it&mdash;and it will pass. Then you can come back to the breath. Your normal response is to react to all your thoughts, and this keeps you ever busy in a sea of confusion. Meditation teaches you to attend to what is taking place within without reacting, and this makes all the difference. It brings you freedom from the mind and its meandering. And in this freedom you begin to experience who you are, distinct from your mental turmoil. You experience inner joy and contentment, you experience relief and inner relaxation, and you find a respite from the tumult of your life. You have given yourself an inner vacation.</p>\n\n<h3>The Foundation for Peace</h3>\n\n<p>This inner vacation is not a retreat from the world but the foundation for finding inner peace. You must also learn to apply the principle of attending in your worldly activities so that you can apply yourself in the world more effectively. Through practicing meditation you can learn to be open to what comes before you in the world and give it your full attention.</p>\n\n<p>Ordinarily, you react to the experiences that come before you in the world in much the same way that you react to your thoughts. If someone says something negative to you, you become upset or depressed. If you lose something, you react emotionally. Your mood depends on what comes before you and, as a result, your life is like a roller coaster ride. You react before you have fully experienced what you are reacting to; what you see or hear immediately pushes a button. You interpret that according to your expectations, fears, prejudices, or resistances. You short-circuit the experience, and thus you limit yourself to one or two conditioned responses. You give up your ability to respond to a situation openly and creatively.</p>\n\n<p>But if you apply the principle of meditation to experiences that come before you, you can fully attend to what is taking place. You can attend to your initial reaction without reacting to your reaction: &ldquo;Oh, look at how threatened I feel by that.&rdquo; You need not deny your reaction. Let yourself be open to experiencing it and it will move through you and allow other spontaneous responses to also come forward, so that you can select the one that is most helpful in that particular situation.</p>\n\n<p>In this way meditation is very therapeutic. It not only leads to inner balance and stability, it also exposes your inner complexes, your immaturities, your unproductive reflexes and habits. Instead of living in these and acting them out, they are brought to your awareness and you can give them your full attention. Only then will they be cleared.</p>\n\n<h3>Patient Practice</h3>\n\n<p>Competent teachers instruct students in how to be free from external influences and how to follow the primary steps, so that the body, senses, and mind are prepared for meditative experiences. If the preliminaries are ignored, then students may waste years and years hallucinating and fantasizing, simply feeding their egos and not attaining any deeper experiences.</p>\n\n<p>But there is one serious problem. Modern students are like children who plant seeds in the evening and early the next morning wake up and start digging up the seeds to see what has happened. Of course, nothing has happened; the seeds are still there so the child covers them up again and pours water on them. Then, in the afternoon, the child wants to examine the seeds again. Let the seeds of your practice grow; give your practice some time to develop.</p>\n\n<p>Have patience and do your practice systematically. Every action has a reaction. It is not possible for you to do meditation and not receive benefits. You may not notice those benefits now, but slowly and gradually you are storing the samskaras (impressions) in the unconscious mind that will help you later. If you sow a seed today, you don&rsquo;t reap the fruit tomorrow, but eventually you will. It takes time to see results; be gentle with yourself.</p>\n\n<p>Meditation means gently fathoming all the levels of yourself, one level after another. Be honest with yourself. Don&rsquo;t care what others say about their experiences&mdash;keep your mind focused on your goal. It is your own mind that does not allow you to meditate, and your untrained mind is like a garbage disposal. To work with your mind, you&rsquo;ll have to be patient, you&rsquo;ll have to work gradually with yourself.</p>\n\n<p>I sometimes hear students say, &ldquo;I have not attained anything; I have been doing meditation for thirteen years!&rdquo; Are you sure that you have been doing meditation? Or did you sit and sleep or dream or think? For thirteen years you have been thinking about many other things in the name of meditation; you think about your work and your boyfriend or girlfriend. You sat for all those years in meditation but you did not really meditate, and then you complain that nothing has happened to you. Do not give your mind space to wander when you meditate, but go step by step in the process. Train yourself. First, pay attention to your posture. Learn to sit correctly. Do your practice systematically. Then work to eliminate the mental and emotional obstacles.</p>\n\n<p>If meditators probe the inner levels of their being, exploring the unknown dimensions of interior life, and if they have learned a systematic and scientific method that can lead them to the next state of experience, then they can go beyond all the levels of their unconscious mind and establish themselves in their essential nature.</p>\n\n<h3>Soundless Sound</h3>\n\n<p>During deep meditation, the ancient sages heard certain sounds called mantras. In the Bible, it is said that those who have an ear to hear will hear. When the mind becomes attuned, it is capable of hearing the voice of the unknown. The sounds that are heard in such a state do not belong to any particular language, religion, or tradition. According to our tradition, which is a meditative tradition more than five thousand years old, mantra and meditation are inseparable, like the two sides of a coin.</p>\n\n<p>All the existing spiritual traditions of the world use a syllable, a sound, a word or set of words, called a mantra, as a bridge for crossing the mire of delusion and reaching the other shore of life. Mantra setu is that practice which helps the meditator make the mind one-pointed and inward, and then finally leads to the center of consciousness, the deep recesses of eternal silence where peace, happiness, and bliss reside.</p>\n\n<p>There are sounds that are created by the external world and heard by the ears, and sounds heard in deep meditation. The latter is called anahata nada, the unstruck sound. Inner sounds, which are heard in deep meditation by the sages, do not vibrate in exactly the same way as sound vibrates in the external world. They have a leading quality. They lead the meditator toward the center of silence within. The following simile can help in understanding this: Imagine that you are standing on the bank of a river and you hear the current as it flows. If you follow the river upstream, you will come to its origin. There, you will find that there is no sound. In the same way, a mantra leads the mind to the silence within. That state is called &ldquo;soundless sound.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The mantra imparted by a teacher to a student is like a prescription given to a patient. There are innumerable sounds, each with a different effect. The teacher must understand which best suits a particular student, according to his or her attitudes, emotions, desires, and habits.</p>\n\n<p>A mantra has four bodies or koshas (sheaths). First, as a word, it has a meaning; another more subtle form is its feeling; still more subtle is a presence, a deep intense and constant awareness of it; and the fourth or most subtle level of the mantra is soundless sound.</p>\n\n<p>Many students continue repeating or muttering their mantra throughout their entire life, but never attain a state of ajapa japa&mdash;that state of constant awareness without any effort. These students strengthen their awareness, but meditate on the gross level only.</p>\n\n<p>Those who go beyond this stage use special mantras that do not obstruct and disturb the flow of breath, but help regulate the breath and lead to a state in which the breath flows through both nostrils equally. In this state the breath and mind function in complete harmony and create a joyous state of mind. When students attain this state, the mind is voluntarily disconnected from the dissipation of the senses. Then they have to deal with the thoughts coming forward from the unconscious mind, that vast reservoir in which we have stored all the impressions of our lifetime. The mantra helps one to go beyond this process, creating a new groove in the mind, and the mind then begins to spontaneously flow into the groove created by the mantra. Finally, when the mind becomes concentrated, one-pointed, and inward, it peers into the latent part of the unconscious, and there, sooner or later, it finds a glittering light. Mantra is the means. Meditation is the method.</p>\n\n<p>In my own practice I sit down and observe my whole being listening to the mantra. I do not remember the mantra or repeat the mantra mentally. Instead I make my whole being an ear to hear the mantra, and the mantra is coming from everywhere. This will not happen to you immediately in meditation, but when you have attained or accomplished something, it will. Then, even if you do not want to do your mantra, it is not possible to avoid it. Even if you decide that you do not want to remember the mantra, it will not be possible. Finally, even the mantra does not exist; only the purpose for which you repeat the mantra is there; you are there. The mantra might still be there, but it exists as an experience that overwhelms your whole being, and is not separate from you.</p>\n\n<p>The most important role mantra plays is during the transition period that every human being will experience. A dying person&rsquo;s senses do not function properly. He gradually loses the sense of sight, the tongue mumbles words that cannot be understood by others, and he is unable to express the mind&rsquo;s thoughts in speech or actions. This painful and pitiable situation frightens the mind of a non-meditator. But if one remembers the mantra for a long time in such a state of loneliness, the mantra begins to lead him, and this miserable period of loneliness and agony is over. The mantra becomes his leader. Only one thought pattern is strengthened by remembering the mantra, and when it is firmly established it leads the individual to his abode of peace, happiness, and bliss.</p>\n\n<h3>The Art of Joyful Living</h3>\n\n<p>So never give up! Accept meditation as a part of your life, just as you eat, sleep, and do other things; make it your goal to have a calm mind, to have a one-pointed mind, to have a tranquil mind. Do not give that up. Meditation leaves a clear indication on your heart, which is reflected on your face. When people speak to me, I can easily tell whether or not they meditate or are even capable of meditation. Their face is the index of their heart.</p>\n\n<p>You can attain the highest state of samadhi through meditation. Then you are here, yet there; you live in the world, yet above; you include all, and exclude none. When the day arrives that every man, woman, and child practices meditation, we will all attain the next step of civilization and realize the unity in all. Liberation can be attained here and now, and that experience is the ultimate goal of human life.</p>",
